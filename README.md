# Case Study - SigLecF+ Neutrophil Analysis
**Big Data Biology** - Module BIT103

**Clients:** 
* Dr Kelly Berube
* Phoebe Ross

The task for this respository is to reanalyse the data collected in a previous study by Shin et al. (2022). Analysis was carried out from raw data processing, through to functional analysis.

## Raw Data Processing

## Differential Gene Expression Analysis

## Enrichment Analysis

## Alternative Splicing Analysis

## R Packages and Version Control
Analysis in R was completed using `R Studio 4.4.1`.

Below is a list of all of the R packages used between the .... scripts.
